# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

- Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss
- These new transformed features are called the Principal Components. 
- It is one of the popular tools that is used for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. 
- PCA generally tries to find the lower-dimensional surface to project the high-dimensional data
- It is a technique to draw strong patterns from the given dataset by reducing the variances.
