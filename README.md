# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

- Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss
- These new transformed features are called the Principal Components. 
- It is one of the popular tools that is used for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. 
- PCA generally tries to find the lower-dimensional surface to project the high-dimensional data
- It is a technique to draw strong patterns from the given dataset by reducing the variances.
- Some real-world applications of PCA are image processing, recommendation system, customer personality analysis, optimizing the power allocation in various communication channels.

The PCA algorithm is based on some mathematical concepts such as:

1. Variance and Covariance
2. Eigenvalues and Eigen factors
